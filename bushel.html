								<h2>The Company</h2>
								<p>Bushel has an app where farmers can share important information and view their documents for the grain elevators they go to. The apps were a white-label app and has 100's of customers using it.</p>
                                <p>Working here, I gained valuable experience. Previously, I was a self-taught iOS developer and had not had the opportunity to collaborate with other mobile developers, as I was the sole mobile developer at my previous company. Here, I had the chance to work alongside other mobile developers.

                                    I expanded my knowledge of Agile development using Jira and delved into unit testing for Swift. Below are some accomplishments I implemented in their apps:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Learned MVP architecture and implemented new features utilizing that in their apps.</li>
                                    <li>Implemented Custom entities. This is a feature that allows web to add simple custom features without needing an app update. This includes polymorphic json that web can setup to display information and have a link to a file.</li>
                                    <li>Worked on Project Stylo. This is an ongoing project I am helped setup. This is a refactor which is basically separating the app's features into Cocoapod/modules. There is the root, Core module, and each feature is a cocoapod.</li>
                                    <li>Implemented unit tests. Unit tests weren't previously used.</li>
                                    <li>I even contributed a little to fast lane: <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/16386">https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/16386</a></li>

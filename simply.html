								<h2>The Company</h2>
								<p>Simply Made Apps has three iOS apps: Simple In/Out, TimeClock, and FrontDesk. Simple In/Out serves as a digital board for employees to track who is present or absent in the office, featuring the notable capability of setting geofences around the workplace. TimeClock enables employees to check in or out using a QR code. Additionally, FrontDesk is an iPad app designed for users to swipe themselves in or out.</p>
								<p>We followed an Agile/Kanban workflow using Jira. All of our code underwent thorough review on GitHub. Prior to merging into the master branch, each change had to be approved through a code review process, and the testing suite had to successfully pass in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. Additionally, we utilized Code Climate to ensure code quality, with changes required to pass this inspection before being merged into the master branch.</p>
								<p>A majority of the app was already written in Objective-C. Any new features we added were implemented in Swift. We aimed for 100% code coverage. Upon joining the team, I found the testing suite to be broken and successfully resolved the majority of the testing issues. Additionally, I introduced MVP architecture to improve the app code structure. We utilized Quick and Nimble for a testing framework. Below, you'll find further details on the accomplishments I achieved for each app.</p>

											<h2>Welcome to my portfolio.</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! My name is Josh Slebodnik, and I'm an iOS Engineer from Fargo, ND. With over 16 years of programming experience, my journey began primarily as a web developer from 2008 to 2014. However, in 2014, I transitioned my focus towards mobile app development, delving into both iOS and Android platforms initially. Over the past four years, I've dedicated my efforts solely to iOS development, honing my skills and expertise in crafting exceptional mobile experiences.
											I also strive for 100% code coverage and a clean app architeture.
										</p>
										<p>
											Having freelanced for the past few months, I'm now eager to pursue a full-time opportunity. Below, you'll find a compilation of projects I've undertaken for various companies throughout my career.

											<h2>Simply Made Apps</h2>
											<h4>August 2021 - June 2023</h4>
										</header>
										<p>I was hired as an iOS developer at Simply Made Apps from 2021 to 2023. During my tenure, I contributed to the development of three iOS apps: Simple In/Out, Timeclock, and FrontDesk. Collaborating with another iOS developer and alongside an Android developer, I played a pivotal role in enhancing these applications.

											Among my notable achievements were implementing MVP architecture, improving the testing suites, addressing various bug fixes, and introducing new functionalities. For a comprehensive overview of my contributions to each app, click 'Learn More'.

											<h2>Bushel</h2>
											<h4>January 2020 - August 2021</h4>
										</header>
										<p>I was hired at Bushel as an iOS developer to work on a platform designed for farmers to manage their products at grain elevators. While I had prior experience in mobile development, this position marked my first dedicated role in iOS development, and working alongside other mobile developers. My time here was immensely educational, and I acquired valuable skills.

											One of the most significant experiences I gained was in agile development practices using Jira, as well as proficiency in Swift unit testing. For a detailed account of my contributions to their apps, click 'Learn More'.</p>

											<h2>Nodak Insurance Company</h2>
											<h4>Full-Time: 2016 - 2020<br />
												Freelance: 2020 - Present
											</h4>
										</header>
										<p>In 2016, I was hired full-time as an iOS and Android developer at Nodak Insurance Company. Even after I left, I continue to serve as their sole mobile app developer on a freelance basis. I oversee the management of three iOS and three Android apps, including Nodak Insurance Company, Battle Creek Insurance, and American West Insurance.

											Among my most notable accomplishments were completely overhauling the app from Objective-C to Swift, redesigning its interface, standardizing code across all three iOS apps using targets, achieving code reuse across all three Android apps via Gradle, introducing an Apple Watch app, and integrating Apple Wallet capability.

											<h2>Forum Communications Company</h2>
											<h4>2014 - 2016</h4>
										</header>
										<p>I was hired as a web developer at Forum Communictions in 2014. During my time there, there arose a need for mobile apps. To meet this demand, I took it upon myself to self-learn iOS and Android development. Subsequently, I developed three apps each for iOS and Android platforms:<br />
											Watch WDAY: This app allows users to watch the news on iPad and Android devices. I also implemented the functionality to Chromecast video clips to televisions.<br />
											Jobs HQ: I developed iOS and Android apps for this company's job search platform, JobsHQ.<br />
											Inforum Now: This app, available on both iOS and Android, provides users with access to news content on their devices.<br />
											These apps are currently no longer in the app stores.
